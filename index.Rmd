This document is the continuation of the paper _Options for Improving Use of ESG data for Sovereign Bond Analysis_ (World Bank 2018). Following interaction with investors in sovereign bonds that use ESG indicators in their country analyses and risk/return profiles of sovereign securities, the World Bank Group (WBG) presents a set of options for improving accessibility, quality (e.g. timeliness and regularity of publication, geographic coverage) and transparency of Emerging Markets data, in particular for ESG data. This paper aims to continue the analysis, better understand underlying data production and management issues that affect availability and provide recommendations for improving the accessibility, quality and coverage of ESG indicators.
