<h1>
<span class="header-section-number">1</span> Background</h1>
<p>This document builds upon research first presented in the discussion paper
<em>Options for Improving Use of ESG for Sovereign Bond Analysis</em> (World Bank, 2018).</p>
<p>Interviews with ESG data providers found that most obtain at least some and often a substantial amount
of data from World Bank databases.
137 indicators were specifically identified from these interviews, of which 127 could be mapped to
active databases in the World Bank’s data API, enabling the authors to <a href="#TODO">perform a rapid
assessment</a> of data coverage and gaps.
The 2018 paper found that “data coverage is a significant issue in WBG data used for ESG.”
Looking at most recent available values (MRVs) by indicator and country, the paper found that
just 41 ESG indicators (out of 127) had a value from 2017 or later (1 year old) for at least 50% of countries;
74 ESG indicators had a value from 2015 or later (3 years old) for at least 50% of countries. However,
while the 2018 paper suggested a set of options for improving the availability and usefulness of
ESG data, it stopped short of further investigating the reasons that might give rise to gaps in data coverage
or suggesting specific strategies to address them.</p>
<p>The objective of this report is to pick up where the previous paper left off, and to better understand
the circumstances that explain gaps in data coverage. The hope is that with a better understanding
of why gaps occur and the pervasiveness of various explanatory factors, effective steps can be established to
eliminate or mitigate gaps, and better understand which kinds of gaps are most relevant for ESG analysis.</p>
<p>This report uses a different selection of ESG indicators than that used in the 2018 report.
Whereas the 2018 report excluded indicators used by providers that the Bank no longer actively maintains,
this report includes those since they are relevant to the analysis. Additionally, this report includes
indicators from two products introduced since the 2018 report: the Blackrock Sovereign Sustainability
Index (BSSI) and the World Bank’s own <a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/environment-social-and-governance-data">curated ESG dataset</a>. Further research into the original
group of data providers has produced additional indicators that have been included. Conversely, we decided
to remove a set of indicators used exclusively by Versk-Maplecroft because the strong similarities
among them (e.g., very similar trade or debt measures) were resulting in double-counting that could
potentially skew the findings. Accordingly, this report is based on a body of 137 indicators, compared
to 134 in the 2018 report.</p>
<p>The other major difference between the indicators of the two reports is that many of them have been updated
since the 2018 report was completed. Many statistical indicators have been updated several times. Accordingly, if the 2018
analysis were re-run using the indicators from this analysis (which date from October, 2019), the findings would likely be quite different,
and different yet again if the analysis were run a year hence. One of the goals of this analysis is to
provide a framework for thinking about data availability and coverage that is reasonably independent of
the data curation cycles for the indicators under study.</p>
<p>Table <a href="background.html#tab:summ">1.1</a> provides a summary of the 134 indicators analyzed in this report
disaggregated by pillar and origin. 44 indicators are environmental
indicators, 66 are social indicators, and 24 are governance indicators. The
World Bank is the primary source of 36 indicators, whereas the UN system is
primary source of 66 indicators, and other organizations are the source for 32
indicators.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> What is a “Data Gap”?</h2>
<p>The term “data gap” is somewhat ambiguous, so we should start by discussing what kinds of gaps can exist
in datasets.
For instance, data could be unavailable for a number of relevant economies, or there
could be gaps in the time series over a relevant time period. There could also be gaps in metadata and other
documentation. Data could also simply be unavailable or undefined for important concepts (such as “resilience”), necessitating the
use of data proxies. While all of these are potentially relevant, the most important gaps in the context of ESG
likely involve the most recently available values compared to the current time period, since ESG
analysis concerns investment decisions being made today and in the near future. Accordingly, this paper
defines a “data gap” as a significant difference between the current calendar year and the most recent available value(s)
(MRVs) for the indicators and economies under study. Gaps in metadata or in time periods before the MRV
are not a primary focus of this analysis.</p>

<div id="how-this-paper-is-structured" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> How This Paper is Structured</h2>
<p>This paper applies three separate approaches to better understand coverage gaps in ESG indicators:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Coverage Analysis.</strong> This approach provides a more detailed and visual picture of temporal gaps in the
ESG indicator set, both historically and by MRV.</li>
<li>
<strong>Explanation Framework Analysis.</strong> This approach sets out a set of reasons why data gaps might occur
as a framework for classifying ESG indicators, and looking at what approaches might be used to mitigate
coverage issues.</li>
<li>
<strong>Variance Analysis.</strong> This approach looks at the temporal variance of ESG indicators to better
understand the impacts of missing data for analysis. It may be possible to impute missing observations
for indicators with low variance, mitigating the impact of data gaps.</li>
</ol>
<p>The paper then concludes with a discussion section and set of recommendations based on the analysis and findings
of each of these sections.</p>
